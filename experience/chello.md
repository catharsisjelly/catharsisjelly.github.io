## Feeds Developer
### March 2001 to January 2002

I worked at Chello in a team of four programmers, working very closely with the CMS development team to improve and ensure that the content from the providers is able to be inserted into this application. The main day to day duties involved writing Perl scripts to pick up the content and alter it for Chello use. I was made redundant from Chelllo due to staff cuts.
