## Programmer
### October 1999 to February 2001

I was tasked with re-building a publishing system that could easily deliver video based news via RealPlayer. The system that was in place was selection of independent scripts that you would run over text files for processing. These were put together by an in-experienced programmer and were undocumented and unreliable. It was rebuilt into a fully fledged publishing system which became more fluid and web based. Some of the content was duplicated to BT for broadband and Netscape for syndication.

During budget announcements we would need to have all the latest market information alongside our video. These were feeds that were consumed and supplied back to the viewer using FT styling.
