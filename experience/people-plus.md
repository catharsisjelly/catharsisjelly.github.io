# [People Plus](https://peopleplus.co.uk) - Remote

## Remote Developer
### May 2021 to March 2023

The Peopleplus development team consisted of three people and I was the main core developer. My main project was focused on providing connections to external services like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Scorm Cloud](https://rusticisoftware.com/products/scorm-cloud/) & [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) to create their main training platform. I was teamed with a less experienced developer, working closely with them via Teams to tutor them in providing a reliable functional application.

My responsibilities included managing and manipulating data to ensure that it was secure and useful as well as using the tools available in the Azure Portal to log and keep the tasks up to date.
