### Oct 2020 to Dec 2020

Chargifi brought me on to work on their new [desk management software](https://chargifi.com/chargifi-wx-desk-booking-software/). Due to the effects of COVID-19 Chargifi saw an opportunity to be able to provide a great interface for to know how many people are in a building, and the state of any desk that contains a capable charging spot.

The Lighting API uses Angular (v10) and talks to Symfony (v5) running API Platform. The majority of the work that I did was on the Angular side of things which involved implementing the front end talking to the API. Most of this work was done by building reusable components and refactoring where necessary. There was also some work implementing some parts of the API and fixing some issues with it.
