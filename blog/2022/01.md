Began to try and play with Vue 3 to try and get a very basic Auth0 app up and running and was annoyed by weird dependency issues usiing [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io). Retried using local Vue3 development and have not been able to make the Auth0 plugin work.

Need to re-work the Auth0 plugin
