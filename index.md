I have been working as an internet programmer since 1999; I focus on the engineering, security and implementation side of the development with a high focus on accessibility and tend to leave the visual side of things to people who have more of an eye and knowledge for it.

In the past I have worked with a variety of teams from large to small and even managed a small team myself. I have worked very closely with clients and am quite meticulous at gathering requirements then translating them to development tasks.

In my spare time I create and produce a creative podcast called [RoughSketch](https://www.roughsketch.online) and have [acted and directed](performance.md) on and off stage.
