## Contract developer
### March 2014 to April 2015

iWantGreatCare aim to be the leading supplier of patient feedback aggregation and generation within the NHS and private healthcare sector. Think of them as the Trip Advisor of healthcare if you like. The initial contract was 2 months and was extended multiple times. The small and closely knit team use the Yii framework as well as other technologies to supply both a web and paper solution for patient feedback. By the time I left they had just over 1.8 million reviews and growing at a steady pace. My work with them varied from dealing with smaller bits of maintenance work to re-working and building some mission critical systems.

I was made an integral part of the team ensuring that I was aware of what was going on with other developers. We all were involved in extensive code review and TDD to try and ensure a reliable system was delivered which included writing tests for code that didnâ€™t have them. As part of my standard practice I always supplied documentation including process diagrams and basic wireframes to help pass on any knowledge.

This was an initial 2 month contract, in which I was commissioned to help out but stayed for just over a year. They aim to be the leading supplier of patient feedback aggregation and generation within the NHS and private healthcare sector. I was part of a small and closely knit team using the Yii framework as well as other technologies in order to supply both a web and paper solution for patient feedback and analysing the results.
