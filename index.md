I have been a developer for the last 20 years and am looking to use my skills to help build better digital products and strategies. My experience includes product management, organising technical roadmaps, providing changes in existing products and creating new products from scratch. My ideal employer uses tech for a good (humane) purpose.

In my spare time, I create and produce a creative podcast called [Rough Sketch Podcast](https://www.roughsketch.online), co-organise an LGBTQ+ comic convention known as [PrideCAF](https://pridecaf.co.uk/) and have [acted and directed](performance.md) on and off stage.
