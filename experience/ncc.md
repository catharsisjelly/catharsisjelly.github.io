# [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.com/uk/) - Remote

## Contract developer
### Feb 2021 to Apr 2021

NCC are working on a platform to enable companies and bug bounty hunters to declare vulnerabilities with software. I'm not able to give too many details at this current time as the platform was not at time of writing.

It's an API written using the Laravel framework that talks to a database and provides information to a front end written in React. As NCC are a security company a great deal of work went into ensuring that code had a significant amount of test coverage.
