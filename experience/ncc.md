## Contract developer
### Feb 2021 to Apr 2021

NCC have a platform that enables companies and bug bounty hunters to declare vulnerabilities with software. I’m not able to give too many more details on the platform was not at the time.

It’s an API written using the Laravel framework that talks to a database and provides information to a front-end written in React. As NCC is a security company a great deal of work went into ensuring that the code had a significant amount of test coverage.
