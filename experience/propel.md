## Contract developer
### March 2020 to July 2020

I was bought on to help finalise the work on the new version of their tool that creates the proposals for their customers. Their entire system was built using Laravel 5 with an upgrade to 6.x. My day to day tasks involved communicating with business analysts in order to understand the requirements and where necessary breaking down the tasks into smaller pieces to aid a more agile development before implementing them. These changes were usually in PHP and JavaScript and did include some Vue components.

A larger piece of work that I have been assigned has been helping them integrate their current system with an external service that is used to perform compliance checks. This integration has been done using a queueable job so that the requests to the external API do not hold up the user experience.
