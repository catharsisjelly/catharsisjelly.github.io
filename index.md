I have been working as an internet programmer since 1999; I tend to focus on the engineering and implementation side of the development. My ideal employer uses tech for a good (humane) purpose.

In the past I have worked with a variety of teams from large to small and even managed a small team myself. I have worked very closely with clients and am quite meticulous at gathering requirements then translating them to development tasks.

In my spare time I create and produce a creative podcast called [Rough Sketch Podcast](https://www.roughsketch.online), co-organise an LGBTQ comic convention known as [PrideCAF](https://pridecaf.co.uk/) and have [acted and directed](performance.md) on and off stage.

## Current position

* [PeoplePlus](https://peopleplus.co.uk) - Remote Developer - May 2021 to March 2023

As the main core developer I have been focusing on providing back-end services to provide connections to external services like [Auth0](https://auth0.com), [Scorm Cloud](https://rusticisoftware.com/products/scorm-cloud/) & [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb). I used Typescript via Azure Functions serverless technology to deliver a basic API that can was consumed by internal & external services. This includes a Vue 2 app (www.learningplus.co.uk) that I co-created with a front-end developer.

During the creation of this application and many other smaller bits of tools programming, I have been tutoring a less experienced developer. Working closely with them via Teams to tutor them in some of the more tricky parts of providing a reliable functional application. Other resposibilityies include the automation of code and documentation to release from the Azure DevOps platform out to the UAT and production services.

I was tasked with helping to assess the best ways to deliver applications which included reviewing frameworks such as Vue (v3), React (v18) and Svelte (v1). These investigations include building static sites and dynamic sites and releasing the software on Cloudflare using their Pages and Workers.

Skills Used: Node (v16+), Javascript, Typescript, Unit testing, REST, SQL, mongodb
