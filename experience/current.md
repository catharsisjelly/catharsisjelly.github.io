# B2B & B2C Finance provider - Newport, Wales

## Contract developer
### March 2020 to Current

The company provides B2B and B2C loans. They are currently aiming to release a major update to their system built using Laravel. My day to day tasks involve implementing a change in their main system which is then shared between an Admin and a Partner portal. These changes are usually in PHP with some JavaScript and flexible Vue components.

A larger piece of work that I have been assigned has been helping them integrate their current system with an external service that is used to perform compliance checks. This integration has been done using a queueable job so that the requests to the external API do not hold up the user experience.
