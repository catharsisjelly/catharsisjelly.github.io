## Contract developer
### Oct 2020 to Dec 2020

Chargifi brought me on to work on their new digital platform. Due to confidentiality Iâ€™m unable to disclose at the moment in depth information on what this platform is set to do. It is built using Angular (v10) and talks to a Symfony (v5) backend running API Platform. The majority of the work that I did was on the Angular side of things which involved talking to the API, displaying the relevant results, processing forms and so on. Most of this work was done by building reusable components and refactoring where necessary. There was also some work implementing some parts of the API and fixing some issues with it.
